Test Environment for SBLIM Params Instrumentation

The SBLIM project offers a Test Suite to perform tests against
the provider implementation and consistence tests against system
values.

Prerequisites 
.............

- sblim-testsuite package propertly installed
- sblim-cmpi-base package propertly installed
- sblim-cmpi-params package propertly installed


Install Configuration Files
...........................

make install
... also installs the configuration file into the testsuite directory
as indicated by configure

make uninstall
... also deletes the cmpi-params specific files out of the testsuite
directories


Run Test
........

Run the test in the testsuite dir by executing 
./sblim-cmpi-params-test.sh
                                                                                

TEST WARNINGS
-------------
Some of the instance tests will report an warning. This is 'normal'
and is a result of the fact that some of kernel parameters, and
therefore their associated /proc files, change constantly.
In particular, random seeds, entropy, and inode values change
all the time so the original value read into in CIM may not be
identical to the current value read by the test scripts.

Also, the IPv4 file /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush sometimes
behaves strangely and unlike most other procfs files
it cannot be viewed (!), i.e.

	ls -l /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush
	-rw-r--r--    1 root     root            0 Feb 16 10:50 /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush

	cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush
	cat: /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush: Invalid argument

Hence the Linux_NetworkIPv4Parameter instance test reports an warning
on this parameter.
